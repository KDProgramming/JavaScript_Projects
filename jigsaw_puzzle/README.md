# Jigsaw Puzzle Game
A dynamic drag-and-drop puzzle game where players can rearrange puzzle pieces on a game board. 
The puzzle pieces are randomly shuffled at the start to create a unique challenge every time the page is loaded.

## Features

  - Each game starts with the puzzle pieces shuffled randomly.
- **Drag-and-Drop Interaction**:
