# Customer Queue Management System
A JavaScript application that manages a dynamic customer queue. 
The program allows users to add, search, remove, and retrieve customers from the queue while dynamically updating the display.

## Features
- **Dynamic Queue Management**:
  - Add customers to the end of the queue.
  - Search for customers and display their position in the queue.
  - Remove a specific customer from the queue.
  - Retrieve and remove the customer at the front of the queue.
- **Live Updates**:
  - Automatically updates the customer list displayed on the webpage whenever changes are made.
- **User Feedback**:
  - Provides real-time status updates about operations (e.g., when a customer is added, found, removed, or retrieved).

## Technologies
- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the queue interface.
- **CSS**: Styles the customer list and controls for better user experience.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the core functionality, including queue operations and DOM manipulation.
