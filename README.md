# JavaScript Projects

This repository contains a collection of small JavaScript programs that I have developed as part of my coursework. 
These projects demonstrate various JavaScript concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, interactivity, and dynamic content. Each project is self-contained and serves as a practical example of a different JavaScript skill.
