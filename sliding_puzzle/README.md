# Sliding Puzzle Game
A fun and interactive sliding puzzle game built with JavaScript. 
The goal is to arrange the puzzle pieces into their correct positions by swapping tiles. 
The game includes a timer, tracks the best completion time, and allows the user to play repeatedly. 

## Features
- **Puzzle Mechanics**: Users can click to swap adjacent pieces to solve the puzzle.
- **Timer**: A countdown timer tracks the time taken to solve the puzzle.
- **Best Time Tracking**: Tracks the user's best time using cookies.
- **Scramble Functionality**: The puzzle pieces are randomly scrambled at the start of each game.
- **Custom Event**: A custom event is triggered when the puzzle is solved, displaying a success message and updating the best time if applicable.

## Technologies
- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the puzzle board and timer display.
- **CSS**: Styling for the puzzle pieces and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for the puzzle mechanics, timer, and best time tracking.
