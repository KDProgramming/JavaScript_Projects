# Fictional Company Website 2
This project is an interactive website for a fictional company, featuring various pages such as a **Home**, **Play Game** page, **Info Square** for adding words, 
a **Purchase Games** page, and a **Games Cart** page. 
The website allows users to engage with a card game, add bouncing words, purchase games, and view their cart with dynamic pricing and totals.

## Features
- **Homepage**: Displays an introduction to the fictional company, with navigation to other pages.
- **Play Game Page**: Users can click a "Deal" button to deal two hands of cards for two players. The game calculates the total of each hand, determines the winner, and displays the result. The user can deal again as many times as desired.
- **Info Square**: A playful page where users can add a word, and this word bounces around in a container. Users can add up to 15 words.
- **Purchase Games Page**: Users can select a game and quantity from dropdown menus, view the price, and add the game to their shopping cart.
- **Games Cart Page**: Displays a table with details about the user's selected products, including product name, description, quantity, price, subtotal, tax, and the total.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Provides the structure for each page.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the layout, form elements, and animations (e.g., bouncing words).
- **JavaScript**: Implements interactivity, including game logic, word movement, dynamic pricing, and cart functionality.
